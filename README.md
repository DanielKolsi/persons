Assumptions
***************
As this was a quick asked to be returned the next day, unit & functional tests were
omitted.

Also, the code contains some 'hard coded' values which could be outsourced to a separate config
file if there were more time.

Generally, the assignment's functionality and UI should match the design exactly or as well as
possible.

Names are in ascending alphabetical order according to the full name.

As the assignment didn't exactly mention where to output the names when "Confirm" was clicked,
the names will be outputted both to browser's console.log & to alert dialog.
