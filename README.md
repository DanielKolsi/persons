Assumptions & notes
***************
As this was a quick test asked to be returned the next day, unit & functional tests were
omitted. Also due to the time restrictions and depending on browser interpretation of CSS, there
are some small differences (e.g. checkbutton color & font families) between the sketch and how
the implemented UI looks like.

Also, the code contains some 'hard coded' values which could be outsourced to a separate config
file if there were more time.

Generally, the assignment's functionality and UI should match the design exactly or as well as
possible.

Names are in ascending alphabetical order according to the full name.

As the assignment didn't exactly mention where to output the names when "Confirm" was clicked,
the names will be outputted both to browser's console.log & to alert dialog.
